# Architecture

This document describes the architecture of Bat AI Core, including its components, their interactions, and the overall system design.

## System Overview

The Bat AI Core system follows a hierarchical architecture:

1. **User Application Layer**

   - Provides the interface for users to interact with the system
   - Handles user requests and displays results

2. **Bat Orchestrator**

   - Central component that manages the entire system
   - Coordinates between different components
   - Handles task distribution and agent management

3. **Task Management Layer**

   - Task Manager: Handles task creation and assignment
   - Task Queue: Stores pending tasks
   - Task Scheduler: Manages task execution timing

4. **Agent Management Layer**

   - Agent Manager: Manages agent lifecycle
   - Agent Pool: Maintains available agents
   - Agent Assignment: Matches tasks to appropriate agents

5. **Agent Layer**
   - Individual agents with specific roles
   - Each agent has access to:
     - Memory system
     - Tool set
     - Language model

## Core Components

### 1. Bat

The central orchestrator that manages agents and tasks.

```typescript
class Bat {
  private agents: Agent[];
  private taskManager: TaskManager;
  private agentManager: AgentManager;

  constructor(agents: Agent[]) {
    this.agents = agents;
    this.taskManager = new TaskManager();
    this.agentManager = new AgentManager(agents);
  }

  async addTask(task: Task): Promise<void> {
    await this.taskManager.queueTask(task);
  }

  async kickoff(): Promise<TaskResult[]> {
    return await this.taskManager.executeTasks();
  }
}
```

### 2. Agent

Specialized AI entities that execute tasks.

```typescript
class Agent {
  private role: string;
  private goal: string;
  private backstory: string;
  private model: BaseChatModel;
  private memory?: AgentMemory;
  private tools?: BatTool[];

  constructor(config: AgentConfig) {
    this.role = config.role;
    this.goal = config.goal;
    this.backstory = config.backstory;
    this.model = config.model;
    this.memory = config.memory;
    this.tools = config.tools;
  }

  async execute(task: Task): Promise<string> {
    // Task execution logic
  }
}
```

### 3. Task

Units of work that agents execute.

```typescript
class Task {
  private description: string;
  private agent: Agent;
  private priority: TaskPriority;
  private timeoutMs: number;
  private retryConfig: TaskRetryConfig;

  constructor(
    description: string,
    agent: Agent,
    priority: TaskPriority = "medium",
    timeoutMs: number = 30000,
    retryConfig: TaskRetryConfig = DEFAULT_RETRY_CONFIG
  ) {
    this.description = description;
    this.agent = agent;
    this.priority = priority;
    this.timeoutMs = timeoutMs;
    this.retryConfig = retryConfig;
  }

  async run(): Promise<string> {
    // Task execution with retry logic
  }
}
```

## Component Interactions

### Task Execution Flow

The task execution flow follows these steps:

1. User submits a task to the Bat orchestrator
2. Bat forwards the task to the Task Manager
3. Task Manager queues the task
4. Agent Manager assigns the task to an appropriate agent
5. Agent executes the task using its tools and memory
6. Results are returned through the chain back to the user

### Memory Management

The memory management system operates as follows:

1. Agent stores new information in memory
2. Memory system persists the data if configured
3. Agent can retrieve information from memory
4. Memory system loads data from storage when needed

## Data Flow

### Task Processing

1. **Task Creation**

   - User creates a task
   - Task is added to the queue
   - Priority is assigned

2. **Agent Assignment**

   - Task Manager selects appropriate agent
   - Agent availability is checked
   - Task is assigned to agent

3. **Task Execution**

   - Agent processes task
   - Tools are used as needed
   - Memory is updated
   - Results are returned

4. **Task Completion**
   - Results are processed
   - Memory is updated
   - Next task is scheduled

## Security Considerations

### 1. Tool Execution

- Sandboxed environment
- Resource limits
- Access control
- Input validation

### 2. Memory Management

- Data encryption
- Access control
- Data retention policies
- Backup procedures

### 3. Agent Communication

- Secure channels
- Message validation
- Rate limiting
- Error handling

## Scalability

### Horizontal Scaling

- Multiple agent instances
- Distributed task queue
- Load balancing
- Fault tolerance

### Vertical Scaling

- Resource optimization
- Memory management
- Caching strategies
- Performance monitoring

## Monitoring and Logging

### System Metrics

- Task execution time
- Agent utilization
- Memory usage
- Error rates

### Logging

- Task execution logs
- Agent activity logs
- Error logs
- Performance metrics

## Error Handling

### 1. Task Errors

- Automatic retries
- Error reporting
- Recovery procedures
- Fallback mechanisms

### 2. Agent Errors

- Health checks
- Automatic recovery
- Error isolation
- State preservation

### 3. System Errors

- Graceful degradation
- Error reporting
- Recovery procedures
- Backup systems
