# Overview

Bat AI Core is a sophisticated framework for building and managing AI agent teams. This guide provides a high-level overview of its architecture, components, and capabilities.

## Core Concepts

### Agents

- Specialized AI entities with specific roles
- Customizable behavior through configuration
- Capable of learning and adapting
- Can collaborate with other agents

### Tasks

- Units of work assigned to agents
- Configurable priority and timeout
- Automatic retry mechanisms
- Progress tracking and monitoring

### Memory

- Short-term and long-term storage
- Context management
- Knowledge persistence
- Learning capabilities

### Tools

- Extensible set of capabilities
- Custom tool creation
- Integration with external services
- Secure execution environment

## Architecture

The Bat AI Core architecture consists of a central Bat orchestrator that manages multiple agents. Each agent has its own memory and tools, and can communicate with other agents. The system follows a hierarchical structure where:

- Users interact with the Bat orchestrator
- Bat manages multiple agents
- Each agent has access to memory and tools
- Agents can collaborate and share knowledge

## Key Features

1. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**

   - Teams of specialized agents
   - Coordinated task execution
   - Knowledge sharing
   - Role-based access control

2. **Advanced Task Management**

   - Priority-based scheduling
   - Timeout control
   - Automatic retries
   - Progress monitoring

3. **Flexible Memory System**

   - Context management
   - Knowledge persistence
   - Learning capabilities
   - Custom storage backends

4. **Extensible Tool System**
   - Built-in tools
   - Custom tool creation
   - Secure execution
   - External service integration

## Use Cases

### Software Development

- Code generation
- Code review
- Bug fixing
- Documentation

### Research and Analysis

- Data gathering
- Information synthesis
- Report generation
- Trend analysis

### Content Creation

- Article writing
- Content editing
- Style maintenance
- SEO optimization

### Business Automation

- Process automation
- Data processing
- Report generation
- Customer service

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**

   ```bash
   npm install @bat-ai/core
   ```

2. **Basic Setup**

   ```typescript
   import { Agent, Bat } from "@bat-ai/core";

   const agent = new Agent({
     role: "developer",
     goal: "Write and maintain code",
     backstory: "A skilled developer agent",
     model: new ChatOpenAI({ temperature: 0 }),
     capabilities: ["code_execution"],
   });

   const bat = new Bat([agent]);
   ```

3. **Task Execution**

   ```typescript
   bat.addTask({
     description: "Write a function to sort an array",
     agentRole: "developer",
   });

   const results = await bat.kickoff();
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Agent Design**

   - Define clear roles and goals
   - Provide detailed backstories
   - Choose appropriate capabilities
   - Configure memory appropriately

2. **Task Management**

   - Break complex tasks into smaller ones
   - Set appropriate priorities
   - Configure timeouts and retries
   - Monitor task progress

3. **Memory Management**

   - Use appropriate token limits
   - Implement persistence when needed
   - Prune irrelevant information
   - Backup important knowledge

4. **Tool Usage**
   - Choose appropriate tools
   - Configure security settings
   - Monitor tool usage
   - Create custom tools when needed
